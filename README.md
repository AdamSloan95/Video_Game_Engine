# Video Game Engine

## Goal
I am currently following a tutorial to create a Game Engine using Java. My intention is to follow the tutorial and gain an understanding that will allow me to build out the game engine into something that I can use to create a game myself.

## Tools
As I build I will try to keep a note of the tools I use either for coding or asset creation.

### Code
| Tool | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Eclipse | IDE : this is the main IDE I will use for the project |
| Maven | For building  |
| Eclipse Shaders | Plug-in for highlightling .glsl syntax within Eclipse|

### Libraries
| Tool | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| LWJGL | Customised as per tutorial with some tweaks. Includes other packaged libraries, see: [pom.xml](pom.xml) |

### Issues

Even though I am working on this project by myself, I had been taking notes of problems I have faced along the way : originally via plain text files
I have decided that i will log these in the [Issues](https://github.com/AdamSloan95/Video_Game_Engine/issues) section incase they are useful anyone else following the tutorial but doing things slightly different as I am.
