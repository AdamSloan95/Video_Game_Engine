More issues! 

issue #1 - shader plugins eclipse 

the shaders plugin for eclipse doesn't appear to be great - not really much highlighting or suggested code.

I think I will likely use vs code for further work on these files as there is a few decent plugins although ideally I would only be using 1 IDE.

This may be wrong and I will see how this looks when working more with shaders.

issue #2 - Window hints setup for mac OS

When drawing my first square using shaders in video #5 I came across another issue that seemed to be to do with my machine again

I updated the window class according to the link below(at macOS) : 

https://www.glfw.org/faq.html#41---how-do-i-create-an-opengl-30-context

This appeared to run without errors after this.

issue #3 - Regex

In the tutorials we are lead to use "\r\n" to detect new lines

This threw errors when I ran so ended up just using "\n" - this is what I am used to using anyway.

Think this \r may be just a windows thing.
