I am working on Mac OS and using Eclipse IDE

In the 6th video I have begun to work on shaders which require working with .glsl files

When you first initialise a file with this extension on the plaform I am using it tries to open the file in xCode all the time - quite annoyingly 

I downloaded a plugin for this here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/glshaders/files/Eclipse%20Shaders%20files/Eclipse%20Plugins%20and%20Features/Eclipse_shaders_1_0_2.zip/download

Then went to apps -> eclipse -> show package contents and dropped the contents of the unzipped download into their respective files : plugins + features.

Then I restarted Eclipse:

Stopped trying to open it in xCode! and syntax highlighting worked. 

Config may need to be done if working in dark mode Eclipse>preferences>shader preferences and set the colours - default text is black so worthwhile doing this.
