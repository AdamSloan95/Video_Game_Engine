More issues! 

the shaders plugin for eclipse doesn't appear to be great - not really much highlighting or suggested code.

I think I will likely use vs code for further work on these files as there is a few decent plugins although ideally I would only be using 1 IDE.

When drawing my first square using shaders in video #5 I came across another issue that seemed to be to do with my machine again

I updated the window class according to the link below(at macOS) :

This appeared to run without errors after this.
